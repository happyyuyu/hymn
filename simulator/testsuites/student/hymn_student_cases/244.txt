	STOR storeE		# stores new store command

 load0: LOAD 0                  # loads the line of code to be moved
storeE: STOR 21			# stores the line of code at the end
        LOAD one        	# loads constant in to look at next line of code
        ADD load0               # increments code line loader by 1
        STOR load0              # stores code line loader
