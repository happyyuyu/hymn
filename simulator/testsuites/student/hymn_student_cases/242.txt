# Prints the first twelve prime numbers
# Code here:
	
pntnxt: LOAD one 		# loads constant in to look at next number
	ADD loada		# increments loada by 1
	STOR loada		# stores loada
 loada: LOAD a			# loads the value of the number to be printed
	WRITE			# writes value to output I/O

	LOAD counter		# loads counter for incrementation
	ADD one			# adds one to counter
	STOR counter		# stores counter value
	
	LOAD max		# loads the maximum number of print statements
	SUB counter		# subtracts the number of primes printed from max
	
	JPOS pntnxt		# tests if number of primes printed is less than max
				# jumps to printnxt, if hasn't printed max times

	HALT			# stop

# variables:
	counter: 0 		# keeps track of index
	one: 1 			# constant for decrementation
	max: 11			# maximum number of print statements (0-11 inclusive)
